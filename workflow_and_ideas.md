# Galaxy Generator Workflow and Ideas

## Workflow

1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize the project with `npm`, set up `webpack` for bundling, and configure `TypeScript`.
2.  **Core Implementation**:
    *   Use the pre-built javascript bundle from the original `Galaxy-Renderer-Typescript` project as a baseline.
    *   Create a `Galaxy` class to manage the properties of the galaxy (stars, dust, etc.).
    *   Create a `GalaxyRenderer` class to handle the WebGL rendering of the galaxy.
3.  **UI Controls**:
    *   Add UI controls to the `index.html` file to allow users to customize the galaxy.
    *   Connect the UI controls to the `GalaxyRenderer` to update the galaxy in real-time.
4.  **Feature Implementation**:
    *   Implement varying arms by controlling the `pertN` property.
    *   Implement arm splitting by adding a sine wave to the angular offset calculation.
    *   Implement configurable start and end arms by modifying the eccentricity calculation.
    *   Implement different star densities by controlling the `numStars` property.
    *   Implement solar system exploration with a smooth transition.
5.  **Documentation**:
    *   Add comments to the code to explain the functionality and performance.
    *   Update this `workflow_and_ideas.md` file with any new ideas or changes to the workflow.

## Ideas for Future Improvements

*   **3D Galaxy**: Extend the generator to create 3D galaxies.
*   **Different Galaxy Types**: Add support for different types of galaxies (e.g., elliptical, irregular).
*   **Animation**: Animate the rotation of the galaxy.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the rendering performance to allow for a larger number of stars.
*   **Presets**: Add a presets menu to showcase different types of galaxies.
*   **Image Export**: Allow users to export the generated galaxy as an image.
*   **Advanced Controls**: Add more advanced controls for fine-tuning the galaxy's appearance (e.g., color, brightness, nebulae).
*   **UI/UX Improvements**: Improve the user interface and experience. For example, add labels to the sliders that show the current value.
*   **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to be more modular and maintainable. The current approach of monkey-patching the `Galaxy` object is not ideal. A better approach would be to extend the `Galaxy` class and override the methods.
*   **Build from source**: Resolve the build issue to be able to build the project from the TypeScript source code. This would make it easier to maintain and extend the project.
*   **Solar System Rendering**: Improve the solar system rendering. Use WebGL to render the planets as 3D spheres with textures. Use the Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams from the link provided by the user to generate the planet surfaces.
*   **Solar System Exploration**: Add more features to the solar system exploration, such as panning, zooming, and selecting individual planets.
*   **Back button**: Add a back button to return from the solar system view to the galaxy view.
